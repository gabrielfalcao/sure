'''The :mod:`sure.doubles.mocks` module currently does not provide
"Mocks" per se, it nevertheless serves as a containment module to
hermetically isolate the types :class:`unittest.mock._CallList` and,
if available within the target Python runtime, the type
:class:`mock.mock._CallList` in a tuple that
:class:`sure.core.DeepComparison` uses for comparing lists of
:class:`unittest.mock.call` or :class:`mock.mock.call` somewhat
interchangeably
